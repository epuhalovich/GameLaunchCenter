## Team Contract

* We will all attend every team meeting and actively participate.
* Should an emergency arise that prevents us from attending a team meeting, we will notify our team immediately.
* The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
* If we do not understand a concept or code, we will ask the team and use course resources (profs, TAs, office hours) to resolve the issue.
* We will respect everyone's ideas and do our best to choose designs and implementations on the merit of the ideas alone, allowing everyone to contribute.

###### Outside of meetings, the work will be done mostly individually.
