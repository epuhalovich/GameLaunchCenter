# Phase 1 - Running instructions
#### (group_0507)

##### Here's how to set up and run our program!

First be sure to follow the steps in README_lab.md for cloning and project setup.

#### Signing In

* Start by creating an account using the SIGN UP button.
* Once you've done that, SIGN IN with the username and password you created. User account information will carry over from session to session in case you close the app.
* You will land at the launch page. Tap "Choose Game" and a dropdown menu will give you options. Currently for Phase 1 only the Sliding Tiles game is available. Alternatively, you can "Log Out" below to sign in with a different account.

#### Sliding Tiles Game

* In the Sliding Tiles menu, you can start a new game, where a drop-down menu will let you choose from three difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard. These provide you with a 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 board respectively.
* While playing, you can manually save your game. Otherwise, an autosave feature saves your game at regular intervals. There is only one save slot per game type, per user. At the Sliding Tiles top menu, choosing "Load Game" will load this slot.
* Tapping "View Scoreboard" will bring up a global scoreboard of the top 5 best scores of all users, as well as your own best 5 scores, depending on who is logged in!
* "Set Numundo" allows you to change the total number of undos you get to use in-game. Undos can help to preserve your end-game score - they will reverse your previous moves entirely as if you'd never made them.
* Use the back button on your phone to exit most screens and return to where you were before.
