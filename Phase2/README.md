## Project setup instructions

* Please note Java SDK version 8 is required. Ensure you have upgraded before attempting to run our program!

1. Open Android Studio. Click "Check out project from Version Control" -> "Git".
2. Copy the Phase 2 Git repository link (above) into the URL box. Click "Clone".
3. Enter any MarkUs login info if prompted.
4. In the "Import Project" window, select "Import project from external model". Choose "Gradle" from the list and click "Next".
5. Set the "Gradle project:" path to Phase2/gamecentre (inside your new project folder) and hit "OK". You should now be able to select the radio button beside "Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)". Do so and click "Finish".
6. If you receive any "Unregistered VCS root detected" message, address this by clicking "Add root". If you receive any "Unsupported Modules Detected" error, you can safely ignore it.
7. Let the project complete its build. You should now be able to run the app!
